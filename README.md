# VSM â€” Viable Systems for Ruby Agents

[![Conforms to README.lint](https://img.shields.io/badge/README.lint-conforming-brightgreen)](https://github.com/discoveryworks/readme-dot-lint)

VSM is a tiny, idiomatic Ruby runtime for building agentic systems with a clear spine: Operations, Coordination, Intelligence, Governance, and Identity.

ðŸŒ¸ Why use VSM?
=============================

Building agentic systems often leads to tangled callback spaghetti and unclear responsibilities. As you add tools, LLM providers, and coordination logic, the complexity explodes. You end up with:

- Callbacks nested in callbacks with no clear flow
- Tool execution mixed with business logic
- No clear separation between "what the agent does" vs "how it decides" vs "what rules it follows"
- Difficulty testing individual components
- Lock-in to specific LLM providers or frameworks

VSM solves this by providing a composable, testable architecture with **named responsibilities** (POODR/SOLID style). You get clear separation of concerns from day one, and can start with a single capsule and grow to a swarmâ€”without changing your interface or core loop.

The Viable System Model gives you a proven organizational pattern: every autonomous system needs Operations (doing), Coordination (scheduling), Intelligence (deciding), Governance (rules), and Identity (purpose). VSM makes this concrete in Ruby.

ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ Who benefits from VSM?
=============================

**Ruby developers building AI agents** who want clean architecture over framework magic. If you've read Sandi Metz's POODR, appreciate small objects with single responsibilities, and want your agent code to be as clean as your Rails models, VSM is for you.

**Teams scaling from prototype to production** who need to start simple (one tool, one LLM call) but know they'll need multiple tools, streaming, confirmations, and policy enforcement later. VSM's recursive capsule design means your "hello world" agent uses the same architecture as your production swarm.

**Developers who want provider independence**. VSM doesn't lock you into OpenAI, Anthropic, or any specific provider. Your Intelligence component decides how to planâ€”whether that's calling an LLM, following a state machine, or using your own logic.

ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ What exactly is VSM?
=============================

VSM is a Ruby gem that provides:

1. **Five named systems** that every agent needs:
   - **Operations** â€” do the work (tools/skills)
   - **Coordination** â€” schedule, order, and arbitrate conversations (the "floor")
   - **Intelligence** â€” plan/decide (e.g., call an LLM driver, or your own logic)
   - **Governance** â€” enforce policy, safety, and budgets
   - **Identity** â€” define purpose and invariants

2. **Capsules** â€” recursive building blocks. Every capsule has the five systems above plus a message bus. Capsules can contain child capsules, and "tools" are just capsules that opt-in to a tool interface.

3. **Async-first architecture** â€” powered by the `async` gem, VSM runs streaming, I/O, and multiple tool calls concurrently without blocking.

4. **Clean interfaces** â€” Ports translate external events (CLI, HTTP, MCP) into messages. Tools expose JSON Schema descriptors that work with any LLM provider.

5. **Built-in observability** â€” append-only JSONL ledger of all events, ready to feed into a monitoring UI.

ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ How do I use VSM?
=============================

## Install

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "vsm", "~> 0.0.1"
```

```bash
bundle install
```

Ruby 3.2+ recommended.

## Quick Example

Here's a minimal agent with one tool:

```ruby
require "securerandom"
require "vsm"

# 1) Define a tool as a capsule
class EchoTool < VSM::ToolCapsule
  tool_name "echo"
  tool_description "Echoes a message"
  tool_schema({ 
    type: "object", 
    properties: { text: { type: "string" } }, 
    required: ["text"] 
  })

  def run(args)
    "you said: #{args["text"]}"
  end
end

# 2) Define your Intelligence (decides what to do)
class DemoIntelligence < VSM::Intelligence
  def handle(message, bus:, **)
    return false unless message.kind == :user
    
    if message.payload =~ /\Aecho:\s*(.+)\z/
      # User said "echo: something" - call the tool
      bus.emit VSM::Message.new(
        kind: :tool_call,
        payload: { tool: "echo", args: { "text" => $1 } },
        corr_id: SecureRandom.uuid,
        meta: message.meta
      )
    else
      # Just respond
      bus.emit VSM::Message.new(
        kind: :assistant, 
        payload: "Try: echo: hello", 
        meta: message.meta
      )
    end
    true
  end
end

# 3) Build your agent using the DSL
capsule = VSM::DSL.define(:demo) do
  identity     klass: VSM::Identity,    args: { identity: "demo", invariants: [] }
  governance   klass: VSM::Governance
  coordination klass: VSM::Coordination
  intelligence klass: DemoIntelligence
  operations do
    capsule :echo, klass: EchoTool
  end
end

# 4) Add a simple CLI interface
class StdinPort < VSM::Port
  def loop
    session = SecureRandom.uuid
    print "You: "
    while (line = $stdin.gets&.chomp)
      @capsule.bus.emit VSM::Message.new(
        kind: :user, 
        payload: line, 
        meta: { session_id: session }
      )
      @capsule.roles[:coordination].wait_for_turn_end(session)
      print "You: "
    end
  end

  def render_out(msg)
    case msg.kind
    when :assistant
      puts "\nBot: #{msg.payload}"
    when :tool_result
      puts "\nTool> #{msg.payload}"
      @capsule.bus.emit VSM::Message.new(
        kind: :assistant, 
        payload: "(done)", 
        meta: msg.meta
      )
    end
  end
end

# 5) Start the runtime
VSM::Runtime.start(capsule, ports: [StdinPort.new(capsule:)])
```

Run it:
```bash
ruby quickstart.rb
# You: echo: hello
# Tool> you said: hello
```

## Building a Real Agent

For a real agent with LLM integration:

```ruby
capsule = VSM::DSL.define(:my_agent) do
  identity     klass: VSM::Identity, 
               args: { identity: "my_agent", invariants: ["stay in workspace"] }
  governance   klass: VSM::Governance
  coordination klass: VSM::Coordination
  intelligence klass: MyLLMIntelligence  # Your class that calls OpenAI/Anthropic/etc
  monitoring   klass: VSM::Monitoring    # Optional: writes JSONL event log
  
  operations do
    capsule :list_files, klass: ListFilesTool
    capsule :read_file,  klass: ReadFileTool
    capsule :write_file, klass: WriteFileTool
  end
end
```

Your `MyLLMIntelligence` would:
1. Maintain conversation history
2. Call your LLM provider with available tools
3. Emit `:tool_call` messages when the LLM wants to use tools
4. Stream `:assistant_delta` tokens as they arrive
5. Emit final `:assistant` message when done

## Core Concepts

### Capsule

A container with five named systems and a message bus:

```
Capsule(:name)
â”œâ”€ Identity      (purpose & invariants)
â”œâ”€ Governance    (safety & budgets)
â”œâ”€ Coordination  (scheduling & "floor")
â”œâ”€ Intelligence  (planning/deciding)
â”œâ”€ Operations    (tools/skills)
â””â”€ Monitoring    (event ledger; optional)
```

Capsules can contain child capsules. Recursion means a "tool" can itself be a full agent if you want.

### Message

```ruby
VSM::Message.new(
  kind:    :user | :assistant | :assistant_delta | :tool_call | :tool_result | :plan | :policy | :audit | :confirm_request | :confirm_response,
  payload: "any",
  path:    [:airb, :operations, :fs], # optional addressing
  corr_id: "uuid",                     # correlate tool_call â†” tool_result
  meta:    { session_id: "uuid", ... } # extra context
)
```

### AsyncChannel

A nonâ€‘blocking bus built on fibers (`async`). Emitting a message never blocks the emitter.

## Tools as Capsules

Any capsule can optâ€‘in to act as a "tool" by including `VSM::ActsAsTool` (already included in `VSM::ToolCapsule`).

```ruby
class ReadFile < VSM::ToolCapsule
  tool_name "read_file"
  tool_description "Read the contents of a UTF-8 text file at relative path."
  tool_schema({
    type: "object",
    properties: { path: { type: "string" } },
    required: ["path"]
  })

  def run(args)
    path = governance_safe_path(args.fetch("path"))
    File.read(path, mode: "r:UTF-8")
  end

  # Optional: choose how this tool executes
  def execution_mode = :fiber   # or :thread
  
  private
  
  def governance_safe_path(rel) = governance.instance_eval { # simple helper
    full = File.expand_path(File.join(Dir.pwd, rel))
    raise "outside workspace" unless full.start_with?(Dir.pwd)
    full
  }
end
```

VSM provides providerâ€‘agnostic descriptors:

```ruby
tool = instance.tool_descriptor
tool.to_openai_tool    # => {type:"function", function:{ name, description, parameters }}
tool.to_anthropic_tool # => {name, description, input_schema}
tool.to_gemini_tool    # => {name, description, parameters}
```

**Why optâ€‘in?** Not every capsule should be callable as a tool. Optâ€‘in keeps coupling low. Later you can autoâ€‘expose selected capsules as tools or via MCP.

## Async & Parallelism

VSM is async by default:

- The bus is fiberâ€‘based and nonâ€‘blocking.
- The capsule loop drains messages without blocking emitters.
- Operations runs each tool call in its own task; tools can choose their execution mode:
  - `:fiber` (default) â€” I/Oâ€‘bound, nonâ€‘blocking
  - `:thread` â€” CPUâ€‘ish work or blocking libraries

You can add Ractor/Subprocess executors later without changing the API.

## Ports (Interfaces)

A Port translates external events into messages and renders outgoing messages. Examples: CLI chat, TUI, HTTP, MCP stdio, editor plugin.

```ruby
class MyPort < VSM::Port
  def loop
    session = SecureRandom.uuid
    while (line = $stdin.gets&.chomp)
      @capsule.bus.emit VSM::Message.new(kind: :user, payload: line, meta: { session_id: session })
      @capsule.roles[:coordination].wait_for_turn_end(session)
    end
  end

  def render_out(msg)
    case msg.kind
    when :assistant_delta then $stdout.print(msg.payload)
    when :assistant       then puts "\nBot: #{msg.payload}"
    when :confirm_request then confirm(msg)
    end
  end

  def confirm(msg)
    print "\nConfirm? #{msg.payload} [y/N] "
    ok = ($stdin.gets || "").strip.downcase.start_with?("y")
    @capsule.bus.emit VSM::Message.new(kind: :confirm_response, payload: { accepted: ok }, meta: msg.meta)
  end
end
```

Start everything:

```ruby
VSM::Runtime.start(capsule, ports: [MyPort.new(capsule:)])
```

### Built-in Ports

- `VSM::Ports::ChatTTY` â€” A generic, customizable chat terminal UI. Safe to run alongside MCP stdio; prefers `IO.console` so it wonâ€™t pollute stdout.
- `VSM::Ports::MCP::ServerStdio` â€” Exposes your capsule as an MCP server on stdio implementing `tools/list` and `tools/call`.

Enable them:

```ruby
require "vsm/ports/chat_tty"
require "vsm/ports/mcp/server_stdio"

ports = [
  VSM::Ports::MCP::ServerStdio.new(capsule: capsule),  # machine IO (stdio)
  VSM::Ports::ChatTTY.new(capsule: capsule)            # human IO (terminal)
]
VSM::Runtime.start(capsule, ports: ports)
```

### MCP Client (reflect and wrap tools)

Reflect tools from an external MCP server and expose them as local tools using the DSL. This uses a tiny stdio JSONâ€‘RPC client under the hood.

```ruby
require "vsm/dsl_mcp"

cap = VSM::DSL.define(:mcp_client) do
  identity     klass: VSM::Identity,    args: { identity: "mcp_client", invariants: [] }
  governance   klass: VSM::Governance
  coordination klass: VSM::Coordination
  intelligence klass: VSM::Intelligence # or your own
  monitoring   klass: VSM::Monitoring
  operations do
    # Prefix helps avoid name collisions
    mcp_server :smith, cmd: "smith-server --stdio", prefix: "smith_", include: %w[search read]
  end
end
```

See `examples/06_mcp_mount_reflection.rb` and `examples/07_connect_claude_mcp.rb`.

Note: Many MCP servers speak LSP-style `Content-Length` framing on stdio. The
current minimal transport uses NDJSON for simplicity. If a server hangs or
doesn't respond, switch the transport to LSP framing in `lib/vsm/mcp/jsonrpc.rb`.

### Customizing ChatTTY

You can customize ChatTTY via options or by subclassing to override only the banner and rendering methods, while keeping the input loop.

```ruby
class FancyTTY < VSM::Ports::ChatTTY
  def banner(io)
    io.puts "\e[95m\n â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ  CUSTOM CHAT  â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ\n\e[0m"
  end

  def render_out(m)
    super # or implement your own formatting
  end
end

VSM::Runtime.start(capsule, ports: [FancyTTY.new(capsule: capsule, prompt: "Me> ")])
```

See `examples/08_custom_chattty.rb`.

### LLM-driven MCP tools

Use an LLM driver (e.g., OpenAI) to automatically call tools reflected from an MCP server:

```ruby
driver = VSM::Drivers::OpenAI::AsyncDriver.new(api_key: ENV.fetch("OPENAI_API_KEY"), model: ENV["AIRB_MODEL"] || "gpt-4o-mini")
cap = VSM::DSL.define(:mcp_with_llm) do
  identity     klass: VSM::Identity,     args: { identity: "mcp_with_llm", invariants: [] }
  governance   klass: VSM::Governance
  coordination klass: VSM::Coordination
  intelligence klass: VSM::Intelligence, args: { driver: driver, system_prompt: "Use tools when helpful." }
  monitoring   klass: VSM::Monitoring
  operations do
    mcp_server :server, cmd: ["claude","mcp","serve"]  # reflect tools
  end
end
VSM::Runtime.start(cap, ports: [VSM::Ports::ChatTTY.new(capsule: cap)])
```

See `examples/09_mcp_with_llm_calls.rb`.

## Observability

VSM ships a tiny Monitoring role that writes an appendâ€‘only JSONL ledger:

```
.vsm.log.jsonl
{"ts":"2025-08-14T12:00:00Z","kind":"user","path":null,"corr_id":null,"meta":{"session_id":"..."}}
{"ts":"...","kind":"tool_call", ...}
{"ts":"...","kind":"tool_result", ...}
{"ts":"...","kind":"assistant", ...}
```

Use it to power a TUI/HTTP "Lens" later. Because everything flows over the bus, you get consistent events across nested capsules and subâ€‘agents.

### MCP and ChatTTY Coexistence

- MCP stdio port only reads stdin and writes strict JSON to stdout.
- ChatTTY prefers `IO.console` or falls back to stderr and disables input if no TTY.
- You can run both in the same process: machine protocol on stdio, human UI on the terminal.

## Writing an Intelligence

The Intelligence role is where you plan/decide. It might:

- forward a conversation to an LLM driver (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini),
- emit `:tool_call` messages when the model asks to use tools,
- stream `:assistant_delta` tokens and finish with `:assistant`.

Minimal example (no LLM, just logic):

```ruby
class MyIntelligence < VSM::Intelligence
  def initialize
    @history = Hash.new { |h,k| h[k] = [] }
  end

  def handle(message, bus:, **)
    return false unless [:user, :tool_result].include?(message.kind)
    sid = message.meta&.dig(:session_id)
    @history[sid] << message

    if message.kind == :user && message.payload =~ /read (.+)/
      bus.emit VSM::Message.new(
        kind: :tool_call,
        payload: { tool: "read_file", args: { "path" => $1 } },
        corr_id: SecureRandom.uuid,
        meta: { session_id: sid }
      )
    else
      bus.emit VSM::Message.new(kind: :assistant, payload: "ok", meta: { session_id: sid })
    end
    true
  end
end
```

In your application, you can plug in provider drivers that stream and support native tool calling; Intelligence remains the same.

## Testing

VSM is designed for unit tests:

- **Capsules**: inject fake systems and assert dispatch.
- **Intelligence**: feed `:user` / `:tool_result` messages and assert emitted messages.
- **Tools**: call `#run` directly.
- **Ports**: treat like adapters; they're thin.

Quick smoke test:

```ruby
require "vsm"

RSpec.describe "tool dispatch" do
  class T < VSM::ToolCapsule
    tool_name "t"; tool_description "d"; tool_schema({ type: "object", properties: {}, required: [] })
    def run(_args) = "ok"
  end

  it "routes tool_call to tool_result" do
    cap = VSM::DSL.define(:test) do
      identity     klass: VSM::Identity, args: { identity: "t", invariants: [] }
      governance   klass: VSM::Governance
      coordination klass: VSM::Coordination
      intelligence klass: VSM::Intelligence
      operations { capsule :t, klass: T }
    end

    q = Queue.new
    cap.bus.subscribe { |m| q << m if m.kind == :tool_result }
    cap.run
    cap.bus.emit VSM::Message.new(kind: :tool_call, payload: { tool: "t", args: {} }, corr_id: "1")
    expect(q.pop.payload).to eq("ok")
  end
end
```

## Design Goals

- **Ergonomic Ruby** (small objects, clear names, blocks/DSL where it helps)
- **High cohesion, low coupling** (roles are tiny; tools are selfâ€‘contained)
- **Recursion by default** (any capsule can contain more capsules)
- **Async from day one** (nonâ€‘blocking bus; concurrent tools)
- **Portability** (no hard dependency on a specific LLM vendor)
- **Observability builtâ€‘in** (event ledger everywhere)

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Executors**: Ractor & Subprocess for heavy/risky tools
- [ ] **Limiter**: perâ€‘tool semaphores and budgets (tokens/time/IO) in Governance
- [ ] **Lens UI**: terminal/HTTP viewer for plans, tools, and audits
- [ ] **Drivers**: optional `vsm-openai`, `vsm-anthropic`, `vsm-gemini` addâ€‘ons for native toolâ€‘calling + streaming
- [ ] **MCP ports**: stdio server/client to expose/consume MCP tools

## FAQ

**Does every capsule have to be a tool?**  
No. Optâ€‘in via `VSM::ActsAsTool`. Many capsules (planner, auditor, coordinator) shouldn't be callable as tools.

**Can I run multiple interfaces at once (chat + HTTP + MCP)?**  
Yes. Start multiple ports; Coordination arbitrates the "floor" per session.

**How do I isolate risky or CPUâ€‘heavy tools?**  
Set `execution_mode` to `:thread` today. Ractor/Subprocess executors are planned and will use the same API.

**What about streaming tokens?**  
Handled by your Intelligence implementation (e.g., your LLM driver). Emit `:assistant_delta` messages as tokens arrive; finish with a single `:assistant`.

**Is VSM tied to any specific LLM?**  
No. Write a driver that conforms to your Intelligence's expectations (usually "yield deltas" + "yield tool_calls"). Keep the provider in your app gem.
